## Imporatant notice - ulimit

Please keep in mind that some of the labs have many virtual machines. To run such, you need to set a higher value for the limit of open files on a host system. The author of this readme had problems with running xm-lab-openvpn with ulimit set to 1024 files. After changing that to 8196 value, the problem disappeared.
